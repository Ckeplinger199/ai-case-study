### Introduction

For this case study, I chose to write about **ExxonMobil**, a major player in the oil and gas industry, due to my involvement in this sector as an oilfield pipe seller. Observing how a company like ExxonMobil leverages A.I. is particularly fascinating to me.

ExxonMobil, considered a "super major" in the industry, earned $12.1 billion in 2023. It was founded in 1999 from the merger of Exxon and Mobil and is currently led by CEO Darren Woods. With a market capitalization of over $500 billion, ExxonMobil has the resources to explore new ventures and technologies such as A.I., which could give them an edge over competitors like Shell, BP, and Chevron.

### A.I. in ExxonMobil's Operations

As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, large corporations like ExxonMobil have begun to implement A.I. to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Below are a few key examples of A.I. applications at ExxonMobil:

1. **Automated Drilling in Guyana**  
   ExxonMobil has implemented an automated drilling system offshore in Guyana, which uses A.I. to maximize penetration while minimizing errors. This system enhances safety for operators and reduces repetitive tasks. It also allows for real-time decision making during drilling operations, adjusting parameters like pressure, torque, and rotation speed on the fly.

2. **Digital Twins**  
   ExxonMobil also uses "digital twin" technology, which creates a virtual replica of real-world drilling environments. This technology allows ExxonMobil to simulate drilling in a controlled environment, helping predict potential outcomes. By using simulations, they can test various scenarios without needing to operate directly in the field.

3. **Data Gathering in the Permian Basin**  
   Collaborating with Microsoft, ExxonMobil leverages machine learning to collect and analyze data in the Permian Basin. Their goal is to create a fully autonomous, closed-loop system that maximizes efficiency.

4. **Machine Learning in Refineries**  
   ExxonMobil is also applying machine learning to create an "ideal operating environment" in its refineries. This initiative is expected to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions, much like how GPS helps a trucker navigate traffic.
