#### ExxonMobil

My case study is on oil and gas giant, ExxonMobil

 For this case study I decided to write about ExxonMobil due to my involvement in the oil and gas industry. I sell oilfield pipe, so seeing a company in the industry leveraging A.I is very interesting to me. ExxonMobil is an oil and gas company considered to be a “super major” by many in the industry, earning 12.1 billion dollars in 2023, ExxonMobil is a major player in the oil and gas industry.  ExxonMobil was founded in 1999 from the merger of Exxon and Mobil, currently spearheaded by their CEO, Darren Woods. Exxon Mobil is a publicly traded company worth over 500 billion dollars. The size and scale of Exxon Mobil allows it to take part in many new ventures and opportunities such as A.I. In a crowded landscape with other large companies such as Shell,BP, or Chevron, the need to have an edge on the competition is paramount. Leveraging the use of A.I and machine learning could be that edge. 

 As A.I becomes more and more commonplace, large corporations such as ExxonMobil have begun to take notice. Exxonmobil has already begun implementing A.I technology into their operations to improve efficiency and to reduce cost. One example of this is the automated drilling system they have begun to use offshore in Guyana. This system leverages A.I technology to maximize penetration while minimizing errors. The system adds a layer of safety for the operators while also negating repetitive tasks. ExxonMobil also uses A.I technology to gather data in the Permian Basin. Collaborating with Microsoft, ExxonMobil is collecting data in the Permian using machine learning and A.I. In their words, this will take them a step closer to create a closed loop system that maximizes efficiency and is fully autonomous. ExxonMobil is using machine learning for other applications as well. A notable example of this is in refineries, ExxonMobil plans to use machine learning in refineries to crate an “ideal operating environment”. The result of this will increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions, they compare the use of machine learning to “a trucker using their GPS to navigate traffic”. Using A.I and machine learning is not just about hopping on a trend for companies like ExxonMobil. These developments have real world applications and real world results. Maximizing efficiency while reducing costs are the end goal for large publicly traded companies such as ExxonMobil.

 While Exxonmobil's use of A.I is proven, the results of its use have not yet been quantified. Time will tell if ExxonMobil’s venture into A.I will pay off, as Darren Woods puts it, “AI is currently overhyped and that it won't solve all problems”. While that train of thought may seem counter iterative to adopting A.I, I see his point. The human element has been trusted long before A.I came into the picture. Sure, it may not be able to do everything now but the future holds many answers that we have not found yet. The current A.I landscape in oil and gas will be very different in 10 years. In my opinion it will not only pay off but reshape an industry that is known for being “outdated”. All because they hunt for fossil fuels, does not mean they need to use ancient technology to do it. With new projects on the horizon such as production optimization and predictive maintenance, ExxonMobil’s drilling operations will become more efficient and smarter with time satisfying shareholders and employees alike. If I were to suggest an A.I technology for ExxonMobil to implement it would be a program to predict demand for oil and gas. This program would compile many different data points such as world events, time of year, and past trends to accurately predict future demands for oil and gas. Using this data, ExxonMobil could scale their operations up or down as needed. This will be very beneficial for an ever changing market fueled by a variety of factors that change on a daily basis. In conclusion, ExxonMobil is using A.I and machine learning to tackle the age old question “how can we provide value to shareholders?”. With many different implementations such as data collection and automated drilling, the future of ExxonMobil is looking more efficient with the upside of profitability. I hope that ExxonMobil along with other major oil and gas companies take notice of emerging A.I technology and implement them as much as they can into their daily operations.
